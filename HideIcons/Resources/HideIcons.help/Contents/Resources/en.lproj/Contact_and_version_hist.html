<p class="Left Normal">Version History</p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 25 April 2024, v2.2.1- Fixed a problem when repeated typing of shortcut (via Services) did not work. </p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 17 September 2023, v2.2- Reduced memory useage and for non Mac App store version. Add "Check for update..." to menu and offer to download if available. </p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 19 January 2023, v2.1.1- Fix possible crash when number of connected monitors changes (can happen temporarily during wake from sleep). </p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 6 January 2023, v2.1- In Ventura (13+) the wrong Desktop is flashed when changing spaces (apparently a bug via Apple). Instead of relying on the ordering of windows in a window level, we now construct window levels so we don't depend on ordering within a level. </p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 6 July 2022, v2.0.2- Fixed crash by performing additional checks on CoreGraphics output (thanks to anonymous crash reports!). </p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 25 May 2022, v2.0.1- Workaround for occasional CoreGraphic delay on updating which Desktops are on screen. Workaround for NSScreen.screens not accurately reflecting attached screens. Update all Desktop windows when Space change (not just the new Space). Added floating black backup Desktops in case normal Desktop pictures get pinned to incorrect Space. Memory leak fixed when number of attached screens change. Added FAQ to Help.</p>

Attempted workaround for Apple bug by delaying 0.15 (0.5) sec every Space Change (Screen Wake) notification.
